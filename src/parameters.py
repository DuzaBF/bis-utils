'''
Symmetrical tetrapolar electrode system:
L - distance between current electrodes
s - distance between measurement electrodes
d_1 - thickness of fat layer
sigma_1 - conductivity of fat at 100 kHz
sigma_2 - conductivity of muscle at 100 kHz
'''
L = 60 * 10**(-3) # [m]
s = 40 * 10**(-3) # [m]
d_1 = 5 * 10**(-3) # [m]
sigma_1 = 0.02 # [S/m]
sigma_2 = 0.34 # [S/m]
